    <p>My research interests lie in Operating Systems, Distributed Systems and
    Networking. I'm particularly interested in adapting and building systems to
    take advantage of new hardware technologies. </p>
    <br>

    <p> I am currently a part of the <a href="http://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/"
    target="_blank">UCSD SysNet Group</a>, and am advised by <a
    href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~voelker/" target="_blank">Geoff Voelker</a>.
    My project explores the benefits and overheads of using non volatile memory
    (NVM) for operating systems data structures. To do so, I am moving the Linux
    page cache to NVM to study the performance benefits of having a pre-filled
    page cache on reboot. I am also using the Intel MPK functionality to prevent
    corruption of persistent data structures from stray writes. </p>
    <br>

    <p> In the past, I have worked with <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/"
    target="_blank">Sorin Lerner</a> and <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/"
    target="_blank">William Griswold</a> as a part of the <a
    href="http://ersp.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank"> Early Research Scholars
    Program</a> at UCSD. My project included crowdsourcing Software Verification
    by gamifying the resource intensive problem of loop invariant
    identification. My group studied the difference in user participation and
    quality of data generated in the two versions of the game created for this
    purpose and presented our results at the UCSD CSE Research Expo. <br>
