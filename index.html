	   		<p> I am a Computer Science, Mathematics and Education enthusiast working towards a BS in Computer Science at <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">UC San Diego</a> with an expected graduation of <b> June 2021</b> . </p>
			<p> I am currently researching under <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~minnes/" target="_blank">Prof Mia Minnes</a> to increase the functionality of <a href="https://flapjs.github.io/FLAPJS-WebApp/" target="_blank">FlapJS</a>, an online tool used to build, simulate, and test automata and other formal models of computation.</p>
			<p> My research interests lie in Theory of Computation, Operating Systems and Computing Education Research. </p>
			<p> When I'm not coding, I like to work out and listen to indie rock music. I'm also an advocate for diversity in STEM and try to do my part by serving as the Vice President of <a href="http://wic.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank"> Women In Computing @ UCSD</a> </p>
